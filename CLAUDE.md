Database Schema
Securities
Composite Key: isin + exchange (handles same stock on different exchanges)
Tracks: symbol, description, currency, conid, exchange
TaxLots
Individual purchase records with date, quantity, cost basis
cost_basis_eur: Pre-converted to EUR for performance
is_open: Tracks active vs closed positions
TickerMappings
Maps IBKR symbols to Yahoo Finance tickers
Built-in mappings for German ETFs (XNAS, XAIX, DBPG, etc.)
Auto-discovery: Tries variations and saves successful mappings
ExchangeRates
Caches Frankfurter API exchange rates
Supports batch fetching (30-day ranges)
Carry-forward for weekends/holidays
MarketPrices
Caches Yahoo Finance daily closing prices
Reduces API calls for historical data
Supports incremental sync
Key Technical Decisions
1. ISIN + Exchange Tracking
Same stock on different exchanges = separate securities

Example: Amazon US (NASDAQ, USD) vs Amazon DE (XETRA, EUR)
Different prices, currencies, tax lots
2. Currency Conversion Strategy
Batch Fetching with Carry-Forward

Batch API call: /2025-01-01..2025-01-31?from=USD&to=EUR
One call fetches 30 days instead of 30 individual calls
Weekend/holiday handling: Use most recent available rate
All rates cached in database
3. Ticker Mapping System
Problem: International ETFs/stocks have different Yahoo Finance tickers

IBKR: DBPG on IBIS2 → Yahoo: DBPG.DE
IBKR: XNAS on IBIS2 → Yahoo: XNAS.DE
IBKR: SMH on LSEETF → Yahoo: SMH.L
Solution: Three-tier lookup

Check custom mappings database
Use exchange suffix logic (IBIS2 → .DE, LSEETF → .L, etc.)
Try variations (.DE, .F, .L, no suffix)
Auto-save successful mappings

Exchange Suffix Mappings:
- XETRA → .DE
- IBIS2 → .DE
- LSEETF → .L
- AEB → .AS
- (Add others as discovered)
4. Market Data Strategy
Yahoo Finance with Rate Limiting

Primary: Yahoo Finance (free, international coverage)
Exchange-specific tickers with suffixes
Auto-discovery tries multiple variations
Caches all prices to minimize API calls

Rate Limiting Protection:
- Random delays: 1-3 seconds per API request
- Security delays: 2-4 seconds between different securities
- User-Agent headers: Chrome browser signature
- Smart retry: Detects rate limits and stops immediately
- Hourly limits: ~500-2,000 requests (Yahoo enforced)
- Burst limits: ~10-20 requests in quick succession

⚠️ CRITICAL: Always get user permission before running market data sync!
5. Portfolio Value Calculation
Dual-Line Chart Data

Cost Basis: Sum of cost_basis_eur from active tax lots
Market Value: Sum of (quantity × market_price × fx_rate)
Calculated daily for chart timeline
Active tax lots: open_date <= date AND (close_date IS NULL OR close_date > date)
Major Issues Fixed
Issue 1: Enum vs String Comparison
Problem: position.assetCategory returned AssetClass.STOCK (enum), but code checked != 'STK' (string)
Result: ALL positions filtered out (0 securities synced)
Fix: Changed to != AssetClass.STOCK (enum comparison)

Issue 2: FlexQueryResponse Navigation
Problem: parser.parse() returns FlexQueryResponse, not FlexStatement
Result: No access to OpenPositions data
Fix: Extract FlexStatement: response.FlexStatements[0]

Issue 3: Currency API 404 Errors
Problem: Recent dates (2026-01-30) not available yet on Frankfurter API
Result: "Currency USD not supported" errors
Fix: Implemented batch fetching with date ranges and carry-forward strategy

Issue 4: German ETF Ticker Mismatches
Problem: IBKR symbol DBPG doesn't work on Yahoo Finance
Result: No market prices for German ETFs
Fix: Built ticker mapping system with auto-discovery

Issue 5: Field Name Mismatch
Problem: Portfolio service returned cost_basis_eur, schema expected total_cost_basis_eur
Result: Pydantic validation errors
Fix: Mapped field names in get_current_portfolio_summary()

Issue 6: Wrong Frankfurter API Endpoint
Problem: Using frankfurter.dev instead of frankfurter.app
Result: 404 errors on currency conversion requests
Fix: Changed base URL to https://api.frankfurter.app in currency_service.py:20

Issue 7: Empty ticker_mappings Migration
Problem: Migration file 0fe97bf472da had only pass statements
Result: ticker_mappings table not created, application crashes
Fix:
- Updated migration file with proper table creation SQL
- Manually created table when migration couldn't downgrade
- Added proper columns: ibkr_symbol, ibkr_exchange, yahoo_ticker, source, created_at

Issue 8: Yahoo Finance Blocking/Rate Limiting
Problem: Multiple issues causing 404/429 errors
Root Causes:
- Outdated yfinance 0.2.36
- No User-Agent headers (looked like bot traffic)
- No rate limiting (burst of 84 requests in 84 seconds)
- Trying 3 ticker variations per security
Fixes:
- Upgraded yfinance: 0.2.36 → 1.1.0
- Added User-Agent headers mimicking Chrome browser
- Added random delays: 1-3 seconds per request
- Added security delays: 2-4 seconds between securities
- Smart retry logic with rate limit detection
- Modified market_data_service.py

Issue 9: Missing Exchange Suffixes
Problem: LSEETF and IBIS2 not in EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES mapping
Result: Unable to map UK-listed securities (e.g., SMH on London Stock Exchange)
Fix: Added to EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES dict:
- LSEETF: '.L' (London Stock Exchange ETFs)
- IBIS2: '.DE' (German electronic exchange)

Issue 10: SMH Ticker Incorrect Price
Problem: SMH showing €8,075 instead of ~€1,650
Root Cause: Using US SMH ticker (VanEck Semiconductor ETF @ $280) instead of UK SMH ticker (iShares MSCI Korea UCITS ETF @ $72.64 on LSE)
Fix Applied:
- Added LSEETF → .L mapping
- Created ticker mapping: SMH@LSEETF → SMH.L
- Deleted incorrect market prices (security_id = 27)
Status: ⏳ Waiting for Yahoo Finance rate limit cooldown (30-60 min) before re-sync

Database Migrations
Created migrations for:

securities, taxlots, exchange_rates, market_prices
ticker_mappings (latest)
Run migrations:

Yahoo Finance Rate Limits and Best Practices
⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

NEVER make Yahoo Finance API calls without explicit user permission
Always wait 30-60 minutes after hitting rate limit before retry
One market data sync can make 50-150+ API requests (depending on securities and date ranges)
Rate Limit Indicators

HTTP 404 errors with "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
Empty JSON responses
Connection timeouts
Protection Mechanisms in Place

Random delays: 1-3 seconds per request
Security delays: 2-4 seconds between different securities
User-Agent headers: Mimics Chrome browser
Smart retry: Stops immediately when rate limit detected
Incremental caching: Only fetches missing dates
Estimated Rate Limits (Yahoo enforced)

Hourly limit: ~500-2,000 requests per hour
Burst limit: ~10-20 requests in quick succession
IP-based: Affects all requests from same machine
Recovery Time

Wait minimum 30 minutes after rate limit
Safe approach: Wait 1 hour before retry
Check user permission before each sync
Recovery Commands

# Check when last market data sync ran (from backend logs)
# Wait 30-60 minutes

# When ready, get user permission first
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/market-data/sync

# Monitor backend logs for rate limit warnings
Current State

⏳ Pending:

SMH market prices need re-sync (waiting for Yahoo Finance rate limit cooldown)
Must wait 30-60 minutes from last API call
User permission required before any market data sync

⚠️ Known Issues:

SMH (security_id = 27) showing incorrect price (~€8,075 instead of ~€1,650)
Prices deleted, awaiting re-fetch with correct SMH.L ticker
Yahoo Finance rate limit hit (burst limit exceeded)
🔮 Future Enhancements:

Tax lot sale tracking (closed positions)
Dividend tracking
Performance attribution
Portfolio allocation pie chart
Dark mode
Export to CSV/Excel
Troubleshooting
If sync shows 0 securities:

Check backend logs for AssetClass enum debug
Verify XML has assetCategory="STK"

If currency conversion fails:

Check Frankfurter API batch fetch status
Verify dates are not too far in future
Look for carry-forward debug messages
Ensure using frankfurter.app (NOT frankfurter.dev)

If market prices missing:

Check ticker mapping debug output
Verify Yahoo Finance ticker variations tried
Add custom mapping if needed
Check if exchange suffix is in EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES dict

If Yahoo Finance rate limit errors (404/429):

⚠️ STOP ALL MARKET DATA REQUESTS IMMEDIATELY
Wait 30-60 minutes before retry
Check yfinance version (must be 1.1.0+)
Verify User-Agent headers are set
Ensure rate limiting delays are active (1-3s per request, 2-4s between securities)
Always get user permission before syncing

If frontend shows errors:

Check backend is running on port 8000
Verify CORS settings in backend
Check browser console for details

If ticker mapping issues:

Check EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES dict has the exchange
Add manual mapping using TickerMappingRepository
Verify Yahoo Finance ticker with browser test
Delete incorrect market_prices entries before re-sync

Current Blocker: Yahoo Finance rate limit - waiting 30-60 min before retry
Next Steps:
1. Wait for rate limit cooldown (30-60 minutes from last sync)
2. Get user permission to retry market data sync
3. Verify SMH shows correct price (~€1,650 instead of ~€8,075)
4. Full end-to-end testing of portfolio dashboard

Data Status:
- Securities: 28 imported ✅
- Tax Lots: 920 imported ✅
- Market Prices: 14,058 cached for 27/28 securities ⏳
- Missing: SMH.L prices (security_id = 27)

Quick Reference - Current Session Status
Issue: Yahoo Finance Rate Limit Hit
When: Last market data sync (check backend logs for exact time)
Impact: SMH showing wrong price (~€8,075 instead of ~€1,650)
Root Cause: Using US SMH ticker instead of UK SMH.L ticker
Fix Applied: Added SMH@LSEETF → SMH.L mapping, deleted wrong prices
Action Required: Wait 30-60 min, get user permission, run market data sync
Expected Result: Only SMH.L prices will be fetched (others cached), SMH value corrects to ~€1,650

Backend Status:
- Running on port 8000 ✅
- Database: backend/portfolio.db ✅
- 27 of 28 securities have correct market data ✅
- 1 security (SMH) awaiting re-sync ⏳

Frontend Status:
- Running on http://localhost:5173 ✅
- Connected to backend ✅
- Displaying portfolio with minor price error (SMH) ⏳

Critical Reminders:
⚠️ DO NOT run market data sync without user permission
⚠️ DO NOT sync before 30-60 min cooldown period
⚠️ Always check yfinance version (must be 1.1.0+)
✅ Rate limiting protections are now in place
