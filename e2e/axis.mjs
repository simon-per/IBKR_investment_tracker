/**
 * The portfolio chart's Y axis must not reserve space below zero that the data cannot reach.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-04 it ran to -20,000 on a phone and -10,000 on desktop while the three
 * default series spanned +1,122 .. +65,025 — nothing negative anywhere. The cause was
 * padding taken as a share of the *whole* range (the market-value line dominates it),
 * pushing the requested minimum to -5,268, which `niceTicks` rounded out to a full
 * negative step. A fifth of the phone plot was permanently blank.
 *
 * `niceTicks.test.ts` pins the arithmetic. This pins the *rendering*, which is the part
 * that was actually wrong on screen and which no unit test observes: the axis is computed
 * from live data at a real viewport, and the tick labels are what a user reads.
 *
 * Deliberately tolerant about a genuine loss: the floor is soft, so a real value below
 * -5k must still be shown. This asserts the axis matches the DATA, not a fixed number.
 *
 *   BASE=https://portfolio.srv1211053.hstgr.cloud node axis.mjs
 *
 * Preconditions: a backend serving real data (a portfolio with no negative series is the
 * normal case and is what makes assertion 2 meaningful; see README).

 * `.recharts-yAxis .recharts-cartesian-axis-tick-value` silently returns zero nodes, which

 * upgrade that moves them back does not quietly blind this check.
