"""
A Steuerwert missing a holding must say so, not just be smaller.

`holdings_snapshot_as_of` omits a lot it cannot price or convert — deliberately, and
CLAUDE.md says so: a position with no resolvable price near that date is left out rather
than counted as zero. That is the right arithmetic and it was, until 2026-08-05, a
completely silent one.

The tax report already handled the snapshot *raising*: `holdings_snapshot_total` becomes
`None` and a warning says the wealth-tax base is unavailable rather than zero. It had
nothing for the snapshot quietly returning fewer rows, which is the **partial** case —
and the partial case is the dangerous one, for the same reason the value timeline's
`+15.3%` was worse than its `-100%`: a plausible number reads as an answer where a
missing one reads as a fault.

It matters more here than anywhere else in the app. This figure is the base for a Swiss
wealth-tax declaration, and `warnings[]` rides on a **successful** 200 response, so it is
structurally invisible unless something renders it — which `TaxTab` and `to_csv` do.
