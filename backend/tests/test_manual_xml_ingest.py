"""
Tests for the offline XML ingest path (`app/cli/ingest_flex_xml.py`).

This path exists because IBKR's Flex Web Service and the Client Portal download button
serve the same statement over independent channels — only the API path spends the token's
request budget, so only it can trip a `Code=1025` lockout. Feeding a downloaded file works
while the token is blocked, and is the only way to reach a prior tax year (our query is
Year-to-Date).

The point of these tests is that the offline route is not a shortcut: it goes through the
same `ingest_flex_statement` as the endpoint and the scheduled jobs, so it must inherit the
empty-statement wipe guard and the idempotent upserts rather than quietly bypassing them.
No network, no credentials.
