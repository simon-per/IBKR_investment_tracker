"""
`sync_stale_fundamentals` has to be able to fetch a security for the first time.

It pre-filtered on `get_stale_metrics(days_old=1)` and bailed when that came back empty.
That query selects metrics rows which already **exist**, so a security with no row was
invisible to it — and whenever every existing row happened to be fresh, this path reported
"No stale fundamentals to update" and a newly-bought security never acquired fundamentals
through it at all. The union that would have caught it (`s.id not in existing_ids or
s.id in stale_ids`) sat one call *below* the guard that stopped it being reached.

The reason this survived is worth pinning too: `sync_stale_ratings` was fixed for exactly
this shape, and both its docstring and CLAUDE.md's duplicated-logic table cite *this*
method as the sibling that "already unions the two sets". Both were describing the inner
function while the entry point pre-filtered — a correct fix justified by a false reading
of the code it was copying. `tests/test_analyst_rating_bootstrap.py` is the mirror of this
file, and its own opening paragraph repeats the claim.

Offline: `_fetch_yahoo_data` is faked, so yfinance is never reached.
