"""
Every service that resolves a Yahoo ticker must resolve it the same way.

`MarketDataService._get_yahoo_ticker` is the canonical one: `ticker_mappings`
first, then `EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES`, with TSE disambiguated by currency (Tokyo `.T`
versus Toronto `.TO`) — the logic the SBI repair turned on. Fundamentals,
dividends and analyst ratings all delegate to it.

`AllocationService` did not. It had its own: mappings, then the bare symbol for
NASDAQ/NYSE/AMEX, then **None**. So it ignored the suffix table, omitted ARCA and
BATS, and could not disambiguate TSE.

The consequence was quiet and large, because a mapping row is only auto-saved when
a *variation* succeeds — i.e. when the primary suffix-derived ticker failed. A
XETRA holding priced fine as `AMZ.DE` therefore has no mapping row, so allocation
returned None and that security got **no sector and no country**, permanently,
while counting toward "missing allocation data".

These pin agreement across the family rather than one implementation, so a future
service that rolls its own is caught the same way.

Offline: resolution is pure lookup — no yfinance, no network.
