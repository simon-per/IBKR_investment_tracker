"""
`/api/dividends/summary` returns exactly what its response_model declares.

A `response_model` is a filter, not an assertion: FastAPI drops any key the model does
not declare and reports nothing. So the model is only a safety net while it stays in
step with the service — the moment the service grows a key the model lacks, that key
disappears from the wire and the only symptom is a blank spot in the UI.

That is not hypothetical here. `DividendSummaryResponse` declared five of the service's
ten keys while the route had no `response_model` at all; the undeclared ones (`source`,
`ibkr_from`, `total_withholding_eur`, ...) are exactly the provenance fields that stop
the Performance tab's *Dividend Income* card presenting IBKR actuals net of real
withholding as though they were gross. Attaching the model without completing it first
would have shipped that blanking as a "hardening" change.

So this compares the two key sets directly rather than spot-checking names.
