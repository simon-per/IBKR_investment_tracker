"""
Guards on the SQLAlchemy metadata itself.

Alembic owns the real schema, so nothing in production ever calls
`Base.metadata.create_all()` — which meant the metadata could quietly become invalid
without anyone noticing. It had: three models declared an index in `__table_args__` using
the *same name* SQLAlchemy already auto-generates for a `mapped_column(index=True)`, so the
metadata held two identically-named Index objects and create_all() died with
"index ix_... already exists". That only surfaced when a test tried to build the full
schema at once.
