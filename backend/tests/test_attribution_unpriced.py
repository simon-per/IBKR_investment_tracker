"""
A holding that cannot be valued is excluded from attribution, never counted at zero.

`get_performance_attribution` computes `value_change = end_mv - start_mv` per security,
and its `get_eur_value` helper returned `Decimal("0.0")` whenever the price or the FX
rate was missing. So a still-held position whose price went stale read as
**`-start_value`** — precisely the shape CLAUDE.md records the disposal term being added
to fix for *sales*, reached by the other route and never covered. The mirror case (an
unvaluable start) fabricates a gain of the same size.

This endpoint is the worst place in the app for it. It renders one bar per security, so
the fabricated figure is not buried in an aggregate: it is the largest bar on the chart,
labelled with the security's own name.

Two further consequences, both fixed by excluding rather than zeroing:
  * `weight_percent` divides by `total_end_mv`, which the zeroed holding is missing
    from, so every *other* security's weight is inflated.
  * `contribution_percent` divides by `total_pnl`, which the fabricated loss moved.

The distinction that makes exclusion safe: a lot held at neither endpoint never reaches
the valuation helper at all, so a fully-sold position keeps its legitimate zero and is
never confused with one that could not be priced.

Offline: prices and rates are seeded directly, no network.
