"""
The maximum chart span is written down in two languages and must agree.

`/api/portfolio/value-over-time` refuses a range wider than `365 * 5` days with a 400,
and `frontend/src/lib/dateRanges.ts` clamps the ALL button to its own `MAX_RANGE_DAYS`
so it never asks for one the server will reject. Two copies of one number, in files that
cannot import each other — the same shape as `breakpoints.test.ts` (Tailwind's scale in
TypeScript) and `test_deploy_guard_hours.py` (the Berlin sync hours in three files).

Both of those exist because a constant duplicated across a language boundary drifts
silently, and this one drifts in a direction with no other symptom: tighten the server
and the ALL button starts returning 400 for every user whose inception is far enough
back, while every test on both sides still passes.

The boundary is exact, not approximate. The client asks for `today - MAX_RANGE_DAYS`,
so the span it sends is exactly `max_days` and the server's `> max_days` is False by one
day. A test asserting only "the client is not larger" would allow the client to shrink
to a year and never notice, so equality is what is pinned.
