"""
An unconvertible dividend is left uncomputed, never stored as if it were EUR.

`compute_dividend_income` is the **second** FX conversion path in
`dividend_service.py`, and it kept

    gross_eur = gross_amount  # fallback: store unconverted

long after the identical line was fixed in `TaxService._to_eur` (2026-07-30) and then in
this same file's `_to_eur`. Neither fix reached it, because it never called either
helper — fixing a helper is not fixing the file.

It is the worst of the three locations. The other two are read paths, where a wrong
figure lasts until the next request; this one is **ingest**, so the foreign amount is
persisted into `gross_amount_eur` and `net_amount_eur` and then read by the Dividends
tab, the forecast, the forward yield and the tax report's DA-1 income. A TWD payment
would sit there roughly 35x high with nothing marking it, and `realized_source` would
still say the data is authoritative.

Reachable rather than theoretical: `get_exchange_rate` raises once both providers are
exhausted, and TWD is outside the ECB set entirely while the er-api fallback refuses any
date older than `FALLBACK_MAX_AGE_DAYS`. The account holds TSMC.

Leaving the row uncomputed is what makes it self-healing — `shares_held IS NULL` is the
"awaiting computation" sentinel `prune_empty_dividends` already refuses to delete, so
the row is retried once a rate exists.
