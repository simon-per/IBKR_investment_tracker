"""
A security Yahoo has no allocation data for must not be re-fetched forever.

`sync_allocation_data` selects every security whose `allocation_last_updated` is
null or older than 7 days, and the **failure** path never set it. So a security
with no Yahoo `.info` was re-fetched on every sync indefinitely: a 1-3s wait, a
request against an IP-based rate limit, and a 2-4s inter-security delay, for an
answer already known.

That is the same unbounded-retry shape `HOLIDAY_GRACE_DAYS` closed for market
prices and `UPSTREAM_RETRY_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` closed for benchmarks.

The two halves have to move together. Stamping the attempt bounds the retry, but
`securities_without_data` counted securities by a *null timestamp* — so on its own
the fix would have reported a security as covered the moment we gave up on it, and
the tab's "needs updating" banner would have cleared while the data was still
missing. The count now keys on the data.

Offline: yfinance is never reached — every fetch is faked.
