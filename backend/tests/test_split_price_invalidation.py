"""
A split restates the cached price history, not just the share count.

`get_missing_dates()` only ever fetches dates we don't already have, so once a split
lands the pre-split closes sitting in `market_prices` are never refreshed — while IBKR
restates the tax lot's quantity immediately. The two halves of the same position then
disagree, and the cost-basis-vs-market-value chart gets a step change at the split date
that nothing detects and nothing self-heals.

So ingestion drops the invalidated rows and lets the next market-data sync refetch them.
The delicate part is *when*: purging on every sync would wipe and refetch the same history
daily, which is the shape of the loops CLAUDE.md rule 1 exists to prevent. It is therefore
keyed on the corporate action being newly inserted, and these tests pin that.

Offline: no IBKR, no Yahoo.
