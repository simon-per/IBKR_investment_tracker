"""
A spun-off line is not a held position before the action that created it.

IBKR reports the received shares against the *parent's* tax lots: the child inherits the
parent's `open_date` (the holding period carries over) and a slice of the parent's cost
basis. So the lot claims ownership from a date when the instrument had no listing, and the
valuation counted it as a held security it could not price — for 7½ months on this
account, after MBGL was spun out of SPGI on 2026-06-30 against lots dated 2025-11-06.
`unpriced_holdings` was 1 across that whole stretch, and the client's `isMeasurable`
correctly refused every one of those days: six months of the monthly-returns table blank,
November 2025 measured over three days, and a "YTD" figure covering six weeks.

The guards matter as much as the rule. Flooring the wrong security deletes a real holding
from its own history, so every ambiguous case must resolve to *not* flooring — which only
leaves the existing warning in place.
