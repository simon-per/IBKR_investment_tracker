"""
Two benchmark cache leaks, both offline:

- The FX prefetch tiled the range with `while current <= end: fetch(current);
  current += 30`, leaving up to 29 days uncovered at the tail — the newest
  chart points dropped past the carry-forward window and were recomputed on
  every request, never caching.
- expected_dates counted every weekday, so a market holiday kept the benchmark
  "missing" and every cold request re-hit Yahoo.
