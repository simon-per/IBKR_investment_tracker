"""
The era splice leaked exactly one dividend per security, at the boundary itself.

`_splice_by_era` keeps yfinance estimates strictly before the first IBKR payment and
IBKR rows from there on. The two sources file the **same** payment under different
dates, though — yfinance under its ex-date, IBKR under its pay-date, weeks apart — so
the first IBKR payment's own estimate sits *before* the boundary and the rule keeps it,
beside the IBKR row it duplicates.

Found by reading the Activity ledger on production, boundary 2026-02-18, ASML held on
two exchanges:

    2026-02-09  yfinance_estimate      2026-02-18  ibkr
    2026-02-10  yfinance_estimate      2026-02-18  ibkr

Four rows for two dividends. Every reader that splices was affected — the breakdown, the
summary card, XIRR's dividend inflows, the tax report's DA-1 income and the ledger — so
it overstated dividend income for the boundary period on all of them at once.

The match is per security, nearest-first, one-to-one and bounded by
`EX_TO_PAY_MAX_LAG_DAYS`. Never by amount: one side is gross and the other net, so equal
amounts are exactly what you cannot rely on.
