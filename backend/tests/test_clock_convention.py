"""
Every timestamp in this application is naive UTC, and nothing enforced it.

`datetime.now()` returns naive *local* time. It was used at ~49 sites and was
only correct because `python:3.11-slim` sets no `TZ`, so the container's local
clock happens to be UTC — an undeclared dependency on the base image that
nothing would have noticed breaking, and that was already wrong on every
developer machine.

The offset lands in three places at once: cache cutoffs expire early, ages read
too old, and `utc_iso()` labels local time as UTC so the browser converts it a
second time. That last one is the "two clocks on one line" failure `utc_iso`'s
own docstring describes, reintroduced through its argument.

`app.clock.utcnow()` is the fix; these tests are what stop the old call from
coming back.
