get_missing_dates must stop asking Yahoo for market holidays.

A weekday the exchange never traded (July 4th, Good Friday) can never gain a
close price, so it used to stay "missing" forever — and one permanently missing
date makes fetch_and_cache_prices re-request the security's ENTIRE range on
every one of the five daily jobs, indefinitely, against an IP-based rate limit.
