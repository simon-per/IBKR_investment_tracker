"""
A recent close must be re-fetched, because the first row of the day was winning.

Yahoo answers a daily-interval request with a bar for the session *in progress*,
whose `Close` is merely the last trade so far. `get_missing_dates()` only ever
returned dates with no row at all, so whichever job wrote that date first owned it
permanently. On production that meant every European close was the 15:00 Berlin
mid-session price — Xetra and Euronext run to 17:30 — and Korea's alternated
between mid-session and final depending on whether the 08:00 or the 15:00 job
happened to land the row first. Read from `market_prices.created_at` on
2026-08-04, not inferred.

That makes this the *precondition* for the intraday market-data slots rather than a
separate cleanup: adding an earlier slot on top of the freeze would have pinned an
even earlier price, making the number worse rather than fresher. So these tests and
`test_market_data_repriced_at_least_every_three_hours_intraday` are two halves of
one change, and neither is safe alone.
