"""
Tests for the cash-flow CLI (`app/cli/manage_cash_flows.py`).

This was the one CLI in the family with no tests at all — `manage_mappings`,
`import_prices`, `prune_empty_dividends` and `purge_dividend_estimates` each have
their own file — and it guards what CLAUDE.md calls the highest-risk number in
the contributions feature: one row on the wrong side of the deposit/transfer line
moves "money added" by the size of a whole portfolio, inventing savings in a
month that had none and double-counting purchases already recorded under the
transferred lots' own open_dates.

`persist_cash_flows` catches IBKR booking a transfer's cash leg as an ordinary
"Deposits & Withdrawals" row automatically, but only when the Transfers section
is enabled and the amounts line up exactly — so the manual override has to work,
and it has to be honest about what it changed.

The fixture mirrors the real account's shape: deposits including one genuine
withdrawal (negative, sign preserved) and one non-EUR row, alongside in-kind
transfers carrying no cash.

Offline: no Yahoo, no IBKR, no network at all.
