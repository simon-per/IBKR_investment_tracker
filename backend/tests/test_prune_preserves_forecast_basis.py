"""
`prune_empty_dividends` must not delete the rows the forecast infers cadence from.

The two features were built against different definitions of "useful row" and the
definitions now collide:

  * `prune_empty_dividends._is_empty()` deletes any *computed* row carrying no income,
    on the stated grounds that it "deletes only rows the readers already ignore".
  * `_forecast_inputs()` is built from the RAW history precisely because "a payout from
    before we owned the share still evidences the schedule, and its per-share amount
    still sizes the next one" — keying on realized income was the bug that left TSMC,
    Samsung, SK Hynix, HPE and SOXQ forecasting nothing.

A pre-ownership yfinance row satisfies both: it carries `amount_per_share`, and it
carries no income. So the forecast is a reader that does *not* ignore it, and pruning
silently reverts the "20 payers project" fix toward the old 15.

The ingest window (`PRE_OWNERSHIP_HISTORY_YEARS`) makes this worse rather than better:
it now keeps exactly three years of pre-ownership history *on purpose*, so almost every
row prune can still reach is one deliberately retained for cadence.
