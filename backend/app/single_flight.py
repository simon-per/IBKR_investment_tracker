"""
One-at-a-time gate with a start cooldown for the sync pipelines.

`/api/` is proxied publicly with no auth, and several POST routes start real work
against rate-limited upstreams: the IBKR Flex token (10 requests/minute, and
repeated failed generations trip the undocumented Code=1025 lockout that blocks
all syncing for hours) and Yahoo Finance (IP-based bans). Nothing prevented
concurrent or rapid-fire triggers — APScheduler's max_instances=1 only fences
jobs it dispatches itself, and POST /api/scheduler/trigger runs the job as a
bare coroutine outside the job store entirely.

Everything that can reach IBKR or Yahoo shares ONE gate name (SYNC_PIPELINE):
two pipelines racing each other is exactly the failure mode, regardless of
which endpoint started them. Scheduled jobs enter with no cooldown (their slots
are hours apart; a colliding job records itself as skipped and the next slot
recovers); the public endpoints add per-route cooldowns so rapid-fire POSTs
get a 429 instead of a queue of pipelines.

In-process by design: the deployment is a single uvicorn worker (the dividends
router's `_sync_in_progress` flag set the precedent). The check-and-set below
has no await between test and set, so it is atomic on the event loop.
