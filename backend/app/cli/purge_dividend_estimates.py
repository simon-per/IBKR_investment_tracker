"""
Drop one security's yfinance-derived dividend rows, so a corrected ticker mapping
can rebuild them.

`dividend_payments` rows tagged `yfinance_estimate` are keyed to whatever Yahoo
ticker was resolved when they were written. When that mapping turns out to have
been wrong, they are poison — and unlike prices, nothing invalidated them:
`manage_mappings disable --purge-prices` clears `market_prices` only, and
`prune_empty_dividends` deletes only rows carrying no income, so a poisoned row
with a plausible positive amount was unreachable by any tool.

That is the SBI case. `SBI@TSE` is SERABI GOLD PLC (CAD, Toronto), but for months
it resolved to an unrelated US listing via the bare-symbol fallback. The mapping
was corrected to `SBI.TO` and the prices were purged and refetched — the two
dividend rows written under the wrong ticker were not. They survived, and because
`_forecast_inputs()` derives cadence from whichever series carries
`amount_per_share` (and skips the IBKR rows when one exists), those two rows alone
defined the schedule: a 31-day gap read as monthly, projecting five payouts a
small gold miner does not pay, while its one real IBKR payment was discarded.

Income was unaffected throughout — the era splice drops estimates after the first
IBKR payment — which is exactly why it went unnoticed. Expect this purge to change
no income figure and to remove a forecast.

IBKR rows are **never** deleted: they come from the Flex cash-transaction ledger,
carry real withholding, and no ticker mapping can invalidate them.

Sixth CLI in the same pattern as `ingest_flex_xml`, `import_prices`,
`manage_mappings`, `manage_cash_flows` and `prune_empty_dividends`, for the same
reason: `/api/` is proxied publicly and unauthenticated, so a route that deletes
financial history is a far larger surface than a command over ssh. Touches no
network — a later scheduled sync refetches through the corrected mapping.
