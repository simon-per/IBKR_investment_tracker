"""
Import daily closing prices for one security from a local JSON file — no Yahoo call.

This is the price-side twin of `ingest_flex_xml.py`, and exists for the same reason:
when the automatic feed is unavailable or wrong, there has to be a way to put correct
data in without waiting on it. Concretely it covers three situations:

- a poisoned cache was deleted and the position is reading 0.00 until the next
  scheduled job (SBI@TSE, 2026-07-27);
- Yahoo cannot resolve a listing at all, so the security would never get prices;
- the prices are better obtained from IBKR itself, whose daily bars are the same
  source as the statements and are quoted in the listing's own currency.

Touches **no** network — so CLAUDE.md rule 1 (never call Yahoo without permission)
simply does not apply to it. Re-running is safe: `MarketPriceRepository.bulk_create`
upserts on `(security_id, date)`, so an import can be repeated or later overwritten by
a scheduled Yahoo fetch.

There is deliberately no upload endpoint. `/api/` is proxied publicly and
unauthenticated, and a route that rewrites the prices every valuation depends on is a
far larger surface than a CLI run over ssh.

Input file:

    {
      "symbol": "SBI", "exchange": "TSE",     // or "security_id": 33
      "currency": "CAD",
      "source": "ibkr",                        // free text, lands in market_prices.source
      "prices": [{"date": "2026-07-27", "close": 4.79}, ...]
    }

Usage, inside the container:

    docker exec backend-portfolio-backend-1 \
        python -m app.cli.import_prices /tmp/sbi_prices.json --dry-run
    docker exec backend-portfolio-backend-1 \
        python -m app.cli.import_prices /tmp/sbi_prices.json
