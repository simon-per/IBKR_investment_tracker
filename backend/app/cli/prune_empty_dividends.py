"""
Delete dividend rows that can never represent income.

yfinance returns a security's ENTIRE dividend history — decades of it — so the
dividend sync stored an ex-date for every payout the company ever made, including
the years before this portfolio owned a share. `compute_dividend_income` then wrote
a zero row for each (no shares held at that ex-date) purely to mark it processed.
On this account that was 1355 of 1446 rows, reaching back to 1985-08.

They are invisible in the UI — both `get_dividend_summary` and
`get_dividend_breakdown` filter them through `DividendService._is_income()` — but
they are not harmless: they made the dividend card report 439 months, and when one
of those read-side filters was relaxed they broke `/api/dividends/breakdown`
outright. `sync_dividend_data` no longer ingests them, so pruning is permanent
rather than a treadmill.

A row is pruned only when it carries no income **and** falls outside the window
`sync_dividend_data` would still ingest (`PRE_OWNERSHIP_HISTORY_YEARS` before the
security's first lot). The income test alone is not sufficient and treating it as
such was a bug: the forecast infers cadence from the RAW history, so an
income-free pre-ownership row with an `amount_per_share` is exactly what lets a
recently-bought payer project at all. Deleting those silently reverts that fix.
Rows still awaiting computation (`shares_held IS NULL`) are always kept: they have
no amounts *yet*, and deleting them would silently drop real income.

Fifth CLI in the same pattern as `ingest_flex_xml`, `import_prices`,
`manage_mappings` and `manage_cash_flows`, for the same reason: `/api/` is proxied
publicly and unauthenticated, so a route that deletes financial history is a far
larger surface than a command over ssh. Touches no network.

    Prunable when the row carries no income **and** the current ingest window would no
    longer create it.

    The income half alone is not enough, and assuming it was is a bug this predicate
    shipped with. `_forecast_inputs()` is built from the RAW history precisely because a
    payout from before we owned the share still evidences the schedule and still sizes
    the next one — keying on realized income is what left TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix, HPE
    and SOXQ forecasting nothing. So a pre-ownership yfinance row is *income-free and
    load-bearing*: the forecast is a reader, and it does not ignore these.

    `sync_dividend_data()` already draws that line, keeping `PRE_OWNERSHIP_HISTORY_YEARS`
    of history before the first lot. Reusing it here means prune deletes exactly what
    ingest would no longer write — one policy rather than two free to drift — so the
    decades of pre-portfolio bookkeeping it was built for still go, and the three years
    deliberately retained for cadence stay.

    `keep_from is None` means the security has no lots at all, which is the one case
    ingest itself refuses to guess a cutoff for; nothing is pruned there either.
