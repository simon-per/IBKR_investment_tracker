    Sync securities and tax lots from IBKR Flex Query.

    This endpoint:
    1. Fetches data from IBKR Flex Query API
    2. Extracts securities (stocks only - no dividends, cash, etc.)
    3. Extracts tax lots (purchase history)
    4. Converts cost basis to EUR
    5. Stores everything in the database

    Answers **200 with `status="skipped"`** — not an error — when IBKR has already
    generated today's statement. It issues roughly one per US-Eastern calendar day and
    refuses the rest with `Code=1001` at the SendRequest step, so the old behaviour was
    to spend a *failed generation* (what `Code=1025` counts) in order to show the user a
    red banner. Nothing is fetched and nothing is lost: the day's statement is already
    ingested.

    `force=true` overrides it, for the one case the recorded history shows really does
    allow a second generation in a day — editing the query definition in the IBKR
    portal. It costs lockout budget if the assumption is wrong, which is why it is not
    the default.
