 * The chart's job here is to say when its own line is not a valuation.
 *
 * A day the backend could not fully price omits the unpriced holdings from market value
 * while keeping their cost, so the line dips for a reason that is not a loss. Measured on
 * production: 14 days past the last cached price the total read a plausible +15%, and 15
 * days past it read −100%. The risk metrics now exclude those pairs, but the line still
 * plots them, so the shape would otherwise speak for itself.
